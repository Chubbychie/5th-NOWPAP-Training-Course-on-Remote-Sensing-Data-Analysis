# The 5th NOWPAP Training Course on Remote Sensing Data Analysis
*** 

### Webinar 1: Nov. 30 - Dec. 2, 2021 
- Mapping Seagrass by Optical Sensors  

### Webinar 2: Dec. 14 - 16, 2021 
- Monitoring and Assessment of Water Quality by Ocean Color Remote Sensing

---
The Special Monitoring and Coastal Environmental Assessment Regional Activity Centre (CEARAC), one of the four Regional Activity Centres (RACs) of the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP), will conduct an intensive training course on the analysis of remote sensing data for marine environment conservation, with a focus on the Northwest Pacific Ocean. 
The online course consists of 2 webinars: Mapping seagrass by optical sensors (Webinar 1); and Monitoring and assessment of water quality by ocean color remote sensing (Webinar 2). 
Each webinar will be held in 3 consecutive days (Webinar 1 on Nov. 30 to Dec. 2, and Webinar 2 on Dec. 14 to 16). 
Both of them will include lectures by experts and hands-on tutorial sessions on analysis of satellite data for the participants to gain useful skills and knowledge to utilize remote sensing data for monitoring and assessing the coastal and marine environment. 
Through the lectures and hands-on sessions, CEARAC will also introduce our recently developed monitoring and assessment tools (Seagrass Mapper, Seagrass Trainer, and Global Eutrophication Watch).

These webinars are targeted at young scientists, postgraduate students, professional researchers and local government officers working in the fields of marine sciences in the Northwest Pacific Region and adjacent area.
